# Questions and Bug Reports

Here are a few quick guidelines to make this an easier and better process for everyone.



## Reporting a bug

First, **make sure the bug hasn't already been reported** by searching [GitHub's issues section](https://github.com/mashery/sparrow/issues).

If no existing issue exists, go ahead and create one. **Please be sure to include all of the following:**

1. A clear, descriptive title (ie. "A bug" is *not* a good title).
2. [A reduced test case.](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) In order to debug code issues, we need to see actual code in a browser.
3. The browser and OS that you're using.



## Asking a question

Before asking, please **make sure the question hasn't already been asked** by searching [GitHub's issues section](https://github.com/mashery/sparrow/issues).
